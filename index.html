        <h1>My Background</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in Kericho, joined primary in 2003 at Mwamba Academy and sat for my K.C.P.E in 2010. Later i joined Kericho Day Secondary School in 2011 and completed in 2014.<br>In 2015 I joined campus to pursue a Diploma in Information Technology and completed in 2018.</p>
        <p>I have worked with the County Government of Kericho as an atachee and later worked at the Kenya National Library as a Secretary.</p>
        <p>Why i decided to take a programming class is i wanted to get out of my comfort zone and explore new things.<br> And also while in campus most programming languages are taught in theory form so I wanted a plattform that could give me the practical part of it.</p>
        <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I love hiking, poetry, movies, <strong>cooking,</strong> travelling and music.</p>
